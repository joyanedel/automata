# Purpose

This project was creation for improving code skills and writing clean code purposes. No intention for making it a library (at the moment at least)

# Goals

Despite the fact this repo was created for learning purposes, it doesn't mean that there is no goals here. This particular project aims to:
* Represent a mathematical idea as DFA, NFA, PDA or any other resources of automata theory into Python Code
* Make those mathematical topics more usable than just take the formal part of any related subject that a student can learn in theory
* Build a Calculator CLI using only structures built here and no any external library that do the work for me. Obviously i'm able to use itertools, math, functools or any other built-in library as any external library that can make some procedures more easy. That doesn't mean i'll try to use it at the first moment i stucked in this.

# Steps
* Built classes that can represent mathematical concepts of automata theory
* Test cases over previously created classes
* Parse inputs into classes representation and test words over it to make sure it works as it expected to work (creating a CLI)
* Represent lexical analysis, tokenization, etc...
* Create basic calculator parsing input into the respective structures, do the maths and output a expected result

# Setup
Python version: `3.10.11`

Libraries:
```bash
typing          (built-in)
